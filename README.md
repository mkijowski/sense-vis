### Directions
- set c_id and c_secret values for increasing github limit rate
How to get c_id, c_secret:
~~~
1. goto: github - settings - application - developer applications - register new application
2. put any values on the form and it will produce client_id and client_secret.
~~~

- Zoom in: mouse click, Zoom out: alt + mouse click

### Testing

- The javascript code in this project is tested using the BDD testing framework, [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)[v2.3.4](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases).
- The Jasmin library, its dependencies, and the actual test runner (SpecRunner.html) is included in the tests directory.
- The tests/spec folder contains the actual tests, written in javascript.
- Writing/adding more javascript tests
    + You *do not* have to download the library. That is already done for *this* project.
    + You can add more tests (written in JS) in tests/spec
    + Declare your cod-under-test and the spec inside SpecRunner.html, i.e. the test-runner.
    + Here are some awesome links to learn more about Jasmine:
        * Official Introduction: http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html
        * A Hello World Tutorial for Jasmine: http://evanhahn.com/how-do-i-jasmine/
    + To run your tests, just open SpecRunner.html in your browser (works on Firefox).
